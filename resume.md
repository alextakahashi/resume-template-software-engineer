## EXPERIENCE
Academic Intern: UC Berkeley Computer Science Department | Berkeley, CA | June 2019 - Dec 2019
* Assisted in labs, office hours, and coding assignments for students in CS61A and CS61B
* Contributed 100+ hours over 2 semesters
* Beta tested and gave feedback on a newly designed class project for CS61A about building a spellchecker system

Front End Developer: Pioneers in Engineering Club | Berkeley, CA | Aug 2018 - May 2019
* Helped build interactive web apps and tools in HTML/CSS/JavaScript as part of PiE’s annual high school robotics competition
* Contributed 120+ hours in work sessions and game days; tools included visual display of the scoreboard and timer, forms for inputting team and round information, and GUI that players use to make game-specific decisions during the round

Medical Device Intern: Children’s Hospital Oakland | Oakland, CA | June 2018 – Aug 2018
* Measured hemoglobin levels of Sickle Cell patients using the HemeChip™ device
* Discovered severe discrepancies in HemeChip™ results compared to trusted hemoglobin measurement assays; presented findings in a scientific poster at research symposium

Galaxy Explorer Program Intern: Chabot Space & Science Center | Oakland, CA | June 2015 – June 2018
* Demoed hands-on science experiments to museum visitors
* Supervised volunteer science demonstrators; served as the communication link between volunteers and museum staff


## PROJECTS
Quadcopter Drone Assembly: Built and programmed DIY quadcopter | Chabot Space & Science Center
* Led a team of 5 students in building a quadcopter by researching and procuring the components and manually assembling them
* Programmed an Arduino flight controller in C++; soldered connections between flight controller, motors, and remote control receiver
* Demoed working quadcopter at symposium

Bear Maps: Map application with path-finding and autocomplete | Data Structures (course)
* Wrote an image-rastering API in Java that generates maps from a database of images to allow for map viewing, scrolling and zooming
* Implemented the A* search algorithm for finding shortest routes between points on the map
* Implemented a system for autocomplete search suggestions using tries (data structure)

CPU: Simulated a RISC-V CPU with digital logic circuits | Computer Architecture (course)
* Simulated the complete RISC-V CPU using the Logisim Evolution program
* Wired all connections of the Datapath, Arithmetic and Logic Unit, Register File, and Control Logic components using digital logic circuits
* Finished CPU can execute all RISC-V instructions

Classify: Wrote a neural net for classification in RISC-V | Computer Architecture (course)
* Constructed an Artificial Neural Net for classifying handwritten digits to their actual number in RISC-V Assembly Language
* Wrote instructions for reading and writing matrices into memory, performing matrix multiplication, and vector dot products in RISC-V

Gitlet: Wrote a simple version control system program | Data Structures (course)
* Designed and architected a version-control system from scratch in Java; developed a system for serializing/deserializing tree data structures holding commit information by storing them as local files
* Built core Git functionality into it including init, add, commit, rm, log, find, status, checkout, branch, reset, and merge
