## EDUCATION

**University of California, Berkeley** | B.S. Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences | GPA: 3.71 ... *FALL 2021*

* **Coursework**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Structures, Statistics & Probability, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Optimization,

## SKILLS

* **Languages**: Python, Java, C, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MATLAB, Arduino,
* **Frameworks and Tools**: ReactJS, TCP/IP, Threading, Git, NumPy, Socket, Socket.IO, Tkinter,

## EXPERIENCE

**Undergraduate Researcher, Software/Hardware**: Embodied Dexterity Group| Berkeley, CA ... *November 2019 - Present*

* Led **team of 3** in designing a physics engine and GUI in Python to interface with a prosthetic arm, simulating the arm's movement and returning touch-related feedback. Incorporated the Model/View/Controller (MVC) design pattern to organize physics, GUI, and communication methods.
* Established TCP connection to LabVIEW program using Python's socket library. Prevented packet loss and out-of-order delivery during communication, ensuring that any movement with our prosthetic arm resulted in accurate simulation and feedback. Allowed for meaningful, confident observations from the collected data.
* Utilized multithreading to run communication/physics and GUI processing in parallel, overcoming stutters in the GUI refresh rate. Enabled the GUI to run at a consistent 60 frames per second, allowing test subjects to focus more easily on the experiment and preventing a potential study limitation.

**Lead Machinist**: FIRST Robotics Competition Team 687 | Carson, CA ... *June 2015 - May 2018*

* Led machining operations for a **10 member team**. Trained a total of **20+ students** on G-Code programming and proper manufacturing techniques to help them grow as engineers.
* Improved record-keeping by implementing a detailed digital logbook of all completed and pending operations to keep team members updated on goals and progress while speeding up production times.

## PROJECTS

**Heal-Bot**: *The Quarantine Companion & Aide* | heal-bot.netlify.app ... *June 2020*

* Developed Heal-Bot in order to provide pandemic information and support, tackling many of the lifestyle changes for those in quarantine. Received feedback from **10+ users**. 
* Worked on Full Stack development to deploy Heal-Bot to the web using Netlify and Heroku.
* Planning on integrating analytical tools to monitor monthly user activity and effectiveness of natural language processing.

**RSA-Encrypted Chat Application**: *Truly Private Messaging* | tinyurl.com/RSA-Messaging ... *April 2020*

  * Built a chat application incorporating RSA encryption to allow others to securely send messages across the internet.
  * Implemented multithreading to allow users to simultaneously enter commands while receiving messages.
  * Utilized Python's socket library to allow communication via TCP/IP, preventing most message loss & errors.
