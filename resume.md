## EDUCATION
**University of California, Berkeley** | B.S. Bioengineering, Minor Computer Science May 2021
* **Coursework**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Discrete Math, Probability, Computational Biology, Databases, Computer Architecture, Computer Security.

## SKILLS
* **Languages**: Python, Java, C, SQL, Swift
* **Libraries/Frameworks**: Pandas, TensorFlow, RESTful APIs, Node.JS, Flask, Numpy, HealthKit, ResearchKit
* **Version Control**: Git
* *...*

## EXPERIENCE
**Research Intern**: UCSF - Henry Roland Laboratory | August 2018-Present
* ● Built a secure Apache HTTPS Server to create a dynamic web application for physicians and researchers to query for and visualize volumetric data.
* ● Utilized Google Compute Instances to construct a high performance computing infrastructure  to process over 7,000 C2-C3 and C3-C4 PSIR images collected from clinical trials. This pipeline segments the spinal cord and extracts volumetric data that will be used to examine  the correlation between spinal cord volume and progression of MS.
* ● Developed a Docker image to run Neeb, a tool that extracts maps of water and myelin content in the brain, on T1 MRI images from clinical trial. Utilized image to build a Flywheel gear, creating an automated pipeline to run this data standardizing protocol on uploaded scans.
* ● Trained a convolutional neural network on patient T1 MRI scans to produce accurate brain stem binary masks; a technique crucial for precise volumetric analysis of neurodegeneration in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients.

**Research Intern**: Berkeley Institute of Data Science | August 2018 - May 2019
*Developed a pipeline to parse ~3000 DNA enhancer sequences of 25 different species of Drosophila and output a data frame organizing the motif sequences of interest. Packaged the pipeline as a command-line tool.

## AWARDS/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
* **3rd Place, iHackHealthAppathon** - October 2019 - Collaborated with UCSF physician and utilized iOS Frameworks like HealthKit and ResearchKit to develop an iOS app for parents with children suffering from Pediatric Pancreatitis which provides resources, a symptom tracker, and real-time communication with primary care physicians.
