## EDUCATION

**University of California, Berkeley** | B.S. Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences | GPA: 3.71 ... *FALL 2021*

* **Coursework**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Structures, Statistics & Probability, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Optimization,

## SKILLS

* **Languages**: Python, Java, C, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MATLAB, Arduino,
* **Frameworks and Tools**: ReactJS, TCP/IP, Threading, Git, NumPy, Socket, Socket.IO, Tkinter,

## EXPERIENCE

**Undergraduate Researcher, Software/Hardware**: Embodied Dexterity Group| Berkeley, CA ... *November 2019 - Present*

* Led team of 3 in designing a physics engine and GUI in Python to interface with a prosthetic arm, simulating the arm's movement and returning touch-related feedback. Incorporated the Model/View/Controller (MVC) design pattern to organize physics, GUI, and communication methods.
* Established TCP connection to LabVIEW program using Python's socket library. Prevented packet loss and out-of-order delivery during communication, ensuring that any movement with our prosthetic arm resulted in accurate simulation and feedback. Simulation accuracy allowed team to make meaningful, confident observations from the collected data.
* Utilized multithreading to run communication/physics and GUI processing in parallel, overcoming stutters in the GUI refresh rate that occured while waiting to receive data from LabVIEW. Enabled the GUI to run at a consistent 60 frames per second while decreasing the cycle time for processing data inputs.

**Lead Machinist**: FIRST Robotics Competition Team 687 | Carson, CA ... *June 2015 - May 2018*

* Trained members on G-Code programming and proper manufacturing techniques to help them grow as engineers.
* Improved organization methods to streamline the machining process and increase team communication for faster production times.

## PROJECTS

**Heal-Bot**: *The Quarantine Companion & Aide* | heal-bot.netlify.app ... *June 2020*

* Developed Heal-Bot in order to provide pandemic information and support, tackling many of the lifestyle changes for those in quarantine.
* Worked on Full Stack development to deploy Heal-Bot to the web using Netlify and Heroku.
* Planning on integrating analytical tools to monitor monthly user activity and effectiveness of natural language processing.

**RSA-Encrypted Chat Application**: *Truly Private Messaging* | tinyurl.com/RSA-Messaging ... *April 2020*

  * Built a chat application incorporating RSA encryption to allow others to securely send messages across the internet.
  * Implemented multithreading to allow users to simultaneously enter commands while receiving messages.
  * Utilized Python's socket library to allow communication via TCP/IP, preventing most message loss and errors.
